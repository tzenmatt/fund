                title: "The Insane Hype Of Retail Traders Gambling The Stock Market - September 6th, 2024",
                content: `
                    Dear Investor,

                    Today's insight is short but, in my opinion, fairly important. As you probably know, retail trading interest spiked during COVID-19. 
                    It then began to slow down. However, there has been a significant recent increase in the number of retail traders 
                    actively managing their funds. For example, in 2020 and 2021, there were record numbers of new accounts. 
                    But what about 2022 and 2023? The market had some volatility, maybe even a slowdown... 
                    I however today predict that this hype will only increase even more over the next couple of months. 

                    Also, the rise of commission-free trading and apps making it easier to start. Social media influence, like Reddit's WallStreetBets, could still be driving interest. 
                    Meme stocks and crypto might play a role here too. People, especially the younger generations like Gen Z, are continuosly becoming convinced that they can beat the stock market.
                    I have noticed this trend through various conversations with all sorts of people. 

                    Another interesting point is that of the gamification of trading apps. 
                    Features like rewards, easy-to-use interfaces, and social features could be driving new account openings even now. Also, the shift towards self-directed investing as opposed to traditional advisors. 
                    More people might prefer managing their own portfolios, leading to more brokerage accounts.

                    I have decided to personally share my insight regarding this matter for any investors who are following Candestra's growth over time. All in all, my prediction is simple:
                    Now is a good time for $HOOD, which currently sits at $18.80 per share. I do not see a world where the American zero-commission trading platform does not experience a surge in its number of
                    users over the next couple of months.

                    As always, please remember that I do not engage in stock picks and none of this should be considered as financial advice. As always, do your own research. I'd be more than happy to
                    answer any of your doubts via the email of the Fund.

                    Best regards,
                    Dimitrios P.
