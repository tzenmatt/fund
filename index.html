    <p class="intro">
      Candestra Holdings Ltd. is a privately held parent company founded and led by Dimitrios Paolo. Our objective is to compound capital at an attractive rate of return by allocating exclusively to our highest-conviction ideas. We follow a value-oriented investment philosophy, seeking opportunities where securities are trading at a meaningful discount to their intrinsic value, and exiting positions once that gap has closed. Because true mispricings are rare, we are willing to size positions significantly when we find them. This disciplined concentration can result in periods of volatility and underperformance. When the Fund begins to accept outside capital, prospective investors must be aligned with our long-term time horizon, otherwise, Candestra is not the right fit.
