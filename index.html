                    The Insane Hype Of Retail Traders Gambling The Stock Market - September 6th, 2024
                </div>
                <div class="insight-content">
                    <p>Dear Investor,</p>
                    <p>Today's insight is short but, in my opinion, fairly important. As you probably know, retail trading interest spiked during COVID-19. It then began to slow down. However, there has been a significant
                        recent increase in the number of retail traders actively managing their funds. For example, in 2020 and 2021, there were record numbers of new accounts. But what about 2022 and 2023? 
                        The market had some volatility, maybe even a slowdown... I however today predict that this hype will only increase even more over the next couple of months. 
    
                        It is crucial to not forget about the rise of commission-free trading and apps that are making it easier to start. Social media influence, like Reddit's WallStreetBets, is not driving substantial
                        interest. Instead, it blinds retail traders from the harsh truth of the nature of markets. Meme stocks and crypto definitely also play a role here. People, especially the younger generations like Gen Z,
                        are continuosly becoming convinced that they can beat the stock market. They are pouring away their hard-earned savings with the hope of increasing their restrained monthly incomes. I have noticed this 
                        trend through the many various conversations I have had with all sorts of people in my different circles. 
    
                        Another interesting point is that of the gamification of trading apps. Features like rewards, easy-to-use interfaces, and social features could be driving new account openings even now. Also, the shift
                        towards self-directed investing as opposed to traditional advisors. More people prefer managing their own portfolios, leading to more brokerage accounts.
    
                        I have decided to personally share my insight regarding this matter for any investors or readers who are following Candestra's growth over time. All in all, my prediction is simple:
                        Now is a good time for Robinhood Markets, Inc ($HOOD), which currently sits at $18.80 per share. I do not see a world where the American zero-commission trading platform does not experience a surge
                        in its number of users over the next couple of months. There is upside potential here with minimal downside risk at this point in time.
    
                        As always, please remember that I do not engage in stock picks and none of this should ever be considered as financial advice. As always, do your own research. I'd be more than happy to
                        answer any of your doubts via the email of the Fund.</p>
