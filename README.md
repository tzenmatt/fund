i am not a professional developer. just working on candestra.com a very early cofounder, first president and chief advisor to our only fund manager (who happens to be my brother), dimitrios paolo. 

as a technololgy enthusiast though, i decided to also manage our website's deployments regarding market updates etc.. it's funny to even have a github profile in the first place!

oh and remember... we do not sell investment advice.
