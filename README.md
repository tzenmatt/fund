Candestra is a value-oriented investment research project founded and led by my brother Dimitrios Paolo (@dimitriospaolo on X).
At this stage Candestra exists primarily as a body of independent research, personal capital allocation and written publications. It is not an authorised investment fund and does not accept external capital.
